Hello! It was finally time for the website to have an 'actual' re-write and re-development. Whilst I am one for self-hosted services, I just wanted something that is easy to work with and modify, enter GitHub Pages and Jekyll. Thanks to them I can just create a new file for each post and commit the changes, Jekyll will build the site for GitHub Pages and all is well!

Now it's a case of starting to note everything down!
