description: The Microsoft AZ-104 exam and my experience from a general sysadmin perspective.
---
Microsoft Ignite 2021 brought with it free exam vouchers for a number of different topics, fortunately for me, I picked my favourite of the list and a good all rounder, AZ-104. Which, after passing, gave me the Microsoft Azure Administrator Associate certification.

I work with Azure on an almost daily basis so I'd like to think I have a good understanding of how most of the things in the spec work, with the exception of a few things that were already set up in my organisation, some of the things I learned during my training have now been implemented into our Azure environment.

My study resources primarily consisted of Pluralsight (shoutout Tim Warner and Michael Bender!), which was paid for by my employer. I whole-heartedly recommend tinkering with your own lab environment, working in IT, that is where you will get the majority of your knowledge and experience. I did a lot of self-paced training in Azure directly by using Spot instances to minimise costs, the highest it went to before I sat the exam was just under ¬£14, which, for the knowledge and certification that brought me, I think was money well spent.
