It was finally time for the website to have an 'actual' re-write and re-development. Whilst I am one for self-hosted services, I wasn't wanting to maintain the upkeep of the site, enter GitHub pages and Jekyll. Thanks to them I can just create a new file for each post and commit the changes, Jekyll will build the site for GitHub Pages and all is well!

Admittedly, the site needs some work, although it's much better than what it used to be!
